System Operations on AWS
------------------------

AWS Regions - 9 regions - in north america(4), south america(1), europe(1), singapore(1), australia(1), tokyo(1)

resolves latency issues

availabilty zones in different regions

ec2 - virtual machine service

auto scaling - well known features, helps to control load(we need to redefine load if its cpu, mem, ..). minimise the cost

Amazon S3 - storage. internet scale storage via API. u will never run out of space

Scope of AWS Resources:
-----------------------
Global
Region
Availabilty Zone

=================
Session2:

vpc: virtual private cloud: AWS charge only for vpn connections other than not charge


 CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

 subnets: how to find how many ip's used or left out:- 

vpc comes with internet gateway 
[0.0.0.0/0] -> means any ip address public - it traverses all subnets and routing entry and can access to internet (google.com)
EIP - Elastic IP - once we got the IP, the IP doesn't change 


AWS Security groups - Firewall ports - At subnet levels, its called ACL(access control list)

ENI - Elastic Network Interface - multiple IPs or websites in same hosts - ENIs are free. Always private. It cannot move across different subnets

NIC Teaming

VPG - Virtual Private Gateway

dedicated tenancy

NACL - Network Access Control List
IGW - Internet Gateway
VGW - Virtual Private Gateway

AWS IAM
=======
Control Resources
MFA: Multifactor Authentication(MFA)
Server Certificates: SSL: Can push IAM ssl certificate to ELB ssl so that we can add ssl to instances under ELBs(Since ELBs can't ssh and can ssh via instance)

amazon ec2
==========

AMI - AMAZON MACHINE IMAGES

ec2 is region specific and ami is scope specific

Tagging:
--------

Tagging Key Value Pairs
Tagging: used for billing, access

SysOps on AWS Enterprise Monitoring:
----------------------------------

 Difference between Nagios and CloudWatch

Cloudwatch cannot monitor memory, because securty policy.

Cloudwatch:
========
Benefits:
------
* Autoscaling - set policy such that if CPU crosses 70%, use another instance

Backup
======

Glacier 
Encrypt EBS volume


Logging | Architectures

* Distributed Log Collection Service
* 3rd party Log Collection Service - SAS Provider
* Centralized Logging rotation
* Analysis * Commercial software / managed solutions
  	   * Hadoop
	     - Distributed, Map Reduce, ideal for log analysis
	   * Redshift
	     - Patallelized, S2 optimized
* Amazon S3 keys 
    - Don't use hostname as part of the keyspace 
    - Optimize for grouping:
        * Application
        * Function
        * Date
* Lifecycle rules
    * Expiration (delete)
    * Move to Amazon Glacier

Autoscaling: verticaling scaling - high cpu  -adding ram ,cpu it leads to downtime - switch off one instance and switch on instance of another 
	     horizontally scaling - 1 server - more capacity- here it is adding servers instead of ram, cpu's


Elastic IPs are free.

When all we use Autoscaling: when load is full in one instance and can switch it another instance

Bootstrapping: should ready to take traffic

============================
IMP: Check for startup programs in your laptop and decrease the bootup load. My Laptop takes lot of time to bootup
=======================================

Session Replication in tomcat and jboss. its there in aws too, its needed when autoscaling affects applications in several instances.

learn definitions like  haproxy,
